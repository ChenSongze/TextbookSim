        content: "Dear Editor,\nWe must not tolerate doubt. In the Border Operation, our forces restored order in under 48 hours, with zero civilian casualties, and swiftly apprehended multiple enemy infiltrators. The operation itself was a direct expression of national will.\nLaughably, some have called our response \"excessive.\" I must reiterate—when our identity or values are questioned, aggressive responses from our side are necessary. Otherwise, the opposition will keep pushing our limits.\nThe textbook must help students understand: questioning who we are is an attack on our legitimacy. We do not argue. We strike back.\nTolerance is the beginning of weakness. Response is the instinct of the nation.\n—Colonel Richard Han",

        content: "Dear Editor,\nI served in logistics command during the Third Border Operation. I understand the pressure we faced. But we must acknowledge that military actions during the operation led to the injury of unarmed civilians, including minors. Such actions—even under pressure—should not be justified.\nSome have claimed that the protests were foreign-influenced. That may be partially true. But even under threat, I avoid justifying aggressive behavior from my side.\nThe moment we start excusing harm, we blur responsibility. I urge you to include in the textbook a clear position: action may be necessary, but necessity must never replace accountability.\n—Commander Elaine Zhou",
